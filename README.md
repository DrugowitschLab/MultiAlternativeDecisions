# MultiAlternativeDecisions
Code for Tajima et al. (2019). Optimal policy for multi-alternative decisions. Nature Neuroscience.

## Installation

All scripts are written in MATLAB and have been tested with MATLAB R2018b. They should also run on earlier versions of MATLAB.

To run the scripts, [download them](https://github.com/DrugowitschLab/MultiAlternativeDecisions/archive/master.zip), and extract them into a folder of your choice, and navigate to this folder within MATLAB.

## Usage

To use any of the script in the `fig` folders, you need to first point MATLAB to the shared utility functions by calling
```Matlab
addpath('shared/')
addpath('shared/bads-1.0.4/')
```
at the MATLAB command line. See the individual `fig` folders for further usage instructions.
